description: Easy-to-use, open-source modules that implement common API logic for seamless integration into Node.js APIs.
---

We created this library of reusable API modules to streamline API development. As backend developers, we often found ourselves doing repetitive work or copying outdated code from old projects and inconsistent online sources.

This led us to build a high-quality repository of reusable API modules that address common functionality used in every backend service. 
In the age of AI code assistants, these modules remain reliably crafted by developers, following best practices with minimal assumptions. 
This makes it easy for any developer to integrate these modules into any API project with flexibility.

Currently, the modules support **Express.js**, and we’re actively working to extend compatibility with other backend languages and popular Node.js frameworks.

> **NOTE:** This isn’t just another package; it’s a source code repository you can copy and use — your code, your way.  
These modules are designed to serve as a solid foundation for API development, so feel free to adapt them to fit your unique needs.

**We recommend using our CLI** to import modules into your codebase. The CLI automates file placement, manages external dependencies, sets up database repositories, and resolves module imports.

Stop reinventing the wheel. Start innovating where it counts.
