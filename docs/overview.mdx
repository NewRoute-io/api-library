description: Easy-to-use, open-source modules that implement common API logic to simplify backend development 
---

We created this library of reusable API modules to simplify API development because we were wasting too much time setting up basic functionality and researching the latest backend best practices.
We wanted a repository of high-quality API modules we can reuse, copy and paste into our projects and have a working backend in seconds. 

In the age of AI code assistants, the modules are reliably built by us, following best practices with minimal assumptions 
so developers can integrate them into any API project and have full ownership and control of their codebase.

Currently, the modules work for **Express.js**, however, we’re actively working to extend compatibility with other backend languages and popular Node.js frameworks. 
We would be more than happy for you to contribute and help us achieve this faster.

> This isn’t just another package; it’s a source code repository you can copy and use — your code, your way.  
The modules are designed to be a solid foundation for any API service, **you should customize them to fit your unique needs**.

**We recommend using our CLI** to import modules into your codebase. It automates file placement, manages external dependencies, sets up database repositories and migrations, and resolves module imports.

Stop reinventing the wheel. Start innovating where it counts.
