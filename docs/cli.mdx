Our CLI offers a quick, hassle-free way to set up a new project or install new API modules with a single command.

While youâ€™re welcome to copy source code directly from our GitHub repo, the CLI significantly simplifies the setup process by automating file placements, dependency resolutions, and configurations.

The "raw" source code of API modules in GitHub may appear complex if copied directly. This setup is intentional for development purposes but can be confusing when integrating manually.

Using the CLI ensures smooth installation by handling:
- Copying files from the module registry
- Installing schema validators and database repositories
- Resolving internal and external dependencies
- Adjusting `import` aliases in each file

## init

Use the `init` command to create a new project using our Node.js template or to add a `.config/modules.json` file to an existing project.

```bash
npx vratix init
```

This command installs the template, sets up `package.json`, and configures the project based on your choices. For details on this process, refer to the [Installation Guide](/docs/install).

### Options
```txt
Usage: vratix init|i [options]

Initialize project

Options:
  -c, --cwd <cwd>  The working directory. Defaults to the current directory.
  -h, --help       Display help for the command
```

## add

The `add` command allows you to add new API modules to your project. It checks if both `package.json` and `.config/modules.json` exist in the project directory. 
If these files are missing, use the [init](#init) command first.

```bash
npx vratix add <module>
```

This command installs all relevant files for the specified module, manages dependencies, and adjusts `import` statements as needed.

### Options
```txt
Usage: vratix add [options] [module...]

Add an API module to your project

Arguments:
  module           The name of the module you want to add

Options:
  -c, --cwd <cwd>  The working directory. Defaults to the current directory.
  -h, --help       Display help for the command
```
