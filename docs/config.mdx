title: Config File
description: Project configuration
---

When you initialize your API project using our CLI, you will see a `.config/modules.json` file created in your project. 
This file includes configurations the CLI uses when adding new modules to your project. See [The CLI](/docs/cli) for more information.

> **NOTE:** If you're simply copying files from our modules, this configuration file is not required.

Most modifications to this file can breatk the CLI’s functionality, but here are a few things you can safely adjust if needed.

## packageManger

Specifies the package manager used to install dependencies. 
Change this if you switch to a different package manager after initial setup.

```json
{
    "packageManger": "npm" | "pnpm" | "yarn",
}
```

## docker

This property indicates whether Docker containers should be configured when installing new modules. 
Set this to `false` if you decide to stop using Docker.

```json
{
    "docker": true | false
}
```

## schemaValidator

Defines the schema validator for request payloads. 
If you change the validator in your codebase, update this property so the CLI installs the correct dependencies accordingly.

```json
{
    "schemaValidator": "zod" | "yup" | "none"
}
```

## database

Set your main database here. If you change databases, update this property so the CLI can install the appropriate DB repositories and schemas. 
See **Databases** for supported DB engines.

```json
{
    "database": "postgres"
}
```

## folderOverrides

This section allows path overrides for core files in your Node.js project. Update these properties if you change the folder structure after initialization.

> By default, the CLI considers `./src` as the root directory for all files. 
For example, `"controllers": "controllers"` will store controller files in `./src/controllers`.

### folderOverrides.controllers 

Specifies the folder path for storing controller files, where you’ll implement business logic.

```json
{
    "folderOverrides" : {
        "controllers": "controllers"
    }
}
```

### folderOverrides.routes 

Defines the location for endpoint route files.

```json
{
    "folderOverrides" : {
        "routes": "routes"
    }
}
```

### folderOverrides.middleware 

Sets the path for middleware files, allowing you to configure custom middleware for Express.js.

```json
{
    "folderOverrides" : {
        "middleware": "middleware"
    }
}
```

### folderOverrides.utils 

Specifies where helper and miscellaneous utility scripts are stored.

```json
{
    "folderOverrides" : {
        "utils": "utils"
    }
}
```
