description: Guide for running the tests that come with each API Module
---

Our API modules come with pre-written tests for controllers and middleware, making it easy to ensure your service functions as expected. 
We have included the test coverage for each module in the documentation. 

## Setup

Make sure to configure `.env` variables in your `vitest.config.ts` file so the tests can run. You can use mock values.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "JWT_SECRET_KEY": "testSecretKey",
    "JWT_ISSUER": "api.tests",
    "S3_BUCKET_NAME": "mockBucketName",
    "S3_BUCKET_REGION": "us-east-1",
    "POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN": "xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx"
  }
}
```

## Running Tests

To execute tests, run the following command from the root of your project:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Coverage Report

To generate a test coverage report, use:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

This command will create a detailed report, allowing you to identify which parts of your code are covered by tests.
