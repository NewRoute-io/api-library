description: Guide for setting up and managing PostgreSQL with our API modules
---
Our API modules currently support PostgreSQL for handling data storage, migrations, and seamless integration with your backend. 
This guide covers configuring PostgreSQL, setting up a local environment, and managing migrations.

## Configuration

To configure PostgreSQL as your database engine, ensure youâ€™ve set up your environment file correctly with the following `.env` variable:

```dotenv
PG_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://{username}:{password}@{hostname}:5432/postgres
```

If you are running the DB as a Docker container, use `postgres` as the hostname.

## Running with Docker

To spin up a local PostgreSQL database, you can use Docker to avoid manual installation:

1. If Docker is enabled in your project, a `/dbConfig/postgres/docker-compose.yaml` file should already be present with a PostgreSQL service setup, 
If you haven't created your project using our CLI, you will need to add a Docker Compose file yourself.

2. To start the PostgreSQL container, run:
```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```

## Migrations

Our CLI generates migration files for each module, making it easy to handle your database updates.

> **NOTE:** All of our modules that have a DB repository implementation come with schema and migration files, which are added to your project when installing them.

1. **Run Migrations** from your project root:

```bash
npm run migrate:up
```

This command will execute migration files in the order specified, ensuring your database schema is up-to-date.

3. **Rollback (Optional):** If you need to undo the latest migration, you can roll it back by running:

```bash
npm run migrate:down
```

This will reverse the latest migration, which is useful for testing changes or rolling back in development environments.

## Template Repository

If you select None as your database during CLI setup, a repository template will be added to your project. 
This template provides a foundation for implementing any database of your choice. 
The repository pattern abstracts data access logic, making it easy to integrate, replace, or modify for various databases.
