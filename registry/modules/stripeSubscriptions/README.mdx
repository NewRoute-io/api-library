## About

The Stripe Subscriptions API module provides a full-featured integration for subscription-based billing using Stripe, allowing developers to quickly monetize their apps without complex setup.
It offloads the logic of managing products and prices to Stripe, keeping your database lightweight and minimizing data synchronization issues.

## Installation

To add the Stripe Subscriptions Module to your project, run:

```bash
npx vratix add stripe-subscriptions
```

## .env

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

- **STRIPE_API_KEY**: A server-side [Stripe API secret key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys)
  - **Default**: None (required)
  - **Example**: `STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_...`
- **STRIPE_WH_SECRET**: Webhook endpoint secret from the Stripe Developer Dashboard
  - **Default**: None (required)
  - **Example**: `STRIPE_WH_SECRET=whsec_...`
- **CHECKOUT_SUCCESS_URL**: Redirect URL after successful payment
  - **Default**: None (required)
  - **Example**: `CHECKOUT_SUCCESS_URL=https://yourdomain.com/payment-success`
- **CHECKOUT_CANCEL_URL**: Redirect URL if payment is canceled
  - **Default**: None (required)
  - **Example**: `CHECKOUT_CANCEL_URL=https://yourdomain.com`

## Dependencies

The `auth-basic` module is required for user management and authentication and will be installed automatically with this module.

## Usage

To start using the module, import the router in your entry file, such as `server.ts`:

```typescript server.ts
import { router as subscriptionRouter } from "@/routes/subscription.js";

app.use("/subscription", subscriptionRouter);
```

This module leverages Stripe as the source of truth, storing minimal subscription data on your end:

- **Customer ID**, **Subscription ID**, and **Plan Key** (`plan`).

### Subscription Key (`plan`)

The `plan` key is composed from the [Stripe price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-lookup_key) `lookup_key`
or the [Stripe product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/object#product_object-name) `name` in lowercase, e.g., `team_pro`,
so checking if a user is subscribed can be as simple as `user.plan === 'team_pro'`.

### Subscription Object

The module simplifies Stripeâ€™s API responses, returning only the relevant properties in a structured format:

```json
{
  "plan": "team_pro",
  "name": "Team Pro Plan",
  "description": "Pro features for you and your whole team",
  "priceId": "price_...",
  "interval": "monthly",
  "priceType": "per_unit",
  "price": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "amount": 2000 // $20.00 represented as a whole intiger
  },
  "features": ["Unlimited API calls", "Team management", "Granular access"]
}
```

### Seat-Based Subscriptions

Seats can be configured during Stripe Checkout by adjusting the `quantity` property for the subscription. To disable this behaviour remove the `line_items.adjustable_quantity` property.

```typescript {6}
const checkout = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  ...customerData,
  customer_creation: "always",
  line_items: [
    {
      adjustable_quantity: { enabled: true },
      quantity: seats,
      price: priceId,
    },
  ],
  subscription_data: { metadata: { userId } },
  saved_payment_method_options: { payment_method_save: "enabled" },
  success_url: CHECKOUT_SUCCESS_URL,
  cancel_url: CHECKOUT_CANCEL_URL,
  mode: "subscription",
});
```

You can also manually set the number of seats by adding the `seats` property before creating a Stripe Checkout URL.
