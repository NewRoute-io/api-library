## About

The **Emails (Postmark) Module** enables you to send transactional and bulk emails using [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com).
It’s designed for secure, efficient email operations within your backend service.
This module doesn’t expose endpoints by default but can easily be adapted to include them as needed.

## Installation

To add the Emails (Postmark) Module to your project, run:

```bash
npx vratix add postmark-email
```

## .env

Add the following environment variable to your `.env` file:

- **POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN**: Postmark server token required to authenticate email sending
  - **Default**: None (required)
  - **Example**: `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN=xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx`

## Dependencies

The module requires the `auth-basic` API module for user management. It will be automatically installed with this module if not already present.

## Usage

Here is an example of using the `sendEmail` controller. If needed, you can pass a custom `postmark.ServerClient` instance when creating the `emailController`:

```typescript
import { createEmailController } from "@/controllers/email.js";
import { createUserRepository } from "@/repositories/user.js";

const userRepository = createUserRepository();
const emailController = createEmailController(userRepository);

type ExamplePayload = {
  foo: string;
};

emailController.sendEmail<ExamplePayload>({
  receiverId: 123,
  templateName: "exampleTemplate",
  payload: { foo: "bar" },
});
```

### Strongly Typed Payloads

To ensure strongly typed payloads, you can pass a generic type to `sendEmail` and `sendBulkEmails`:

```typescript {4}
type SendEmail<T> = {
  receiverId: number;
  templateName: string;
  payload: T;
};
```

You can also define payload types in `/src/controllers/email.ts` like this:

```typescript
type ExampleTemplatePayload = {
  foo: string;
};

type EmailPayload = ExampleTemplatePayload | object;

type SendEmail = {
  receiverId: number;
  templateName: string;
  payload: EmailPayload;
};
```

### Sending Customized Bulk Emails

For bulk emails with customized content for each recipient, modify the types as follows:

```typescript
type SendBulkEmails<T> = {
  templateName: string;
  payload: Omit<SendEmail<T>, "templateName">[];
};
```

> **NOTE**: Adjust the controller logic to handle the `payload` array if sending unique data to multiple recipients.

### Errors

Below are common errors with solutions for this module:

| Error Code | Name           | Solution                                                                              |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 404        | EmailNotFound  | Ensure the user has an email associated with their account                            |
| 500        | SendEmailError | An issue occurred with the Postmark SDK. Verify your Postmark server token is correct |

## DMARC Setup Instructions (Optional)

If you have configured DMARK for your domain you can skip this part.

To enhance deliverability and security, follow these steps to configure DMARC for your email domain.
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) helps protect against email spoofing and ensures that emails sent from your domain are authenticated. [Postman's What is DMARC](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/892-what-is-dmarc)

### 1. Set Up SPF and DKIM Records

- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: Define the servers authorized to send emails for your domain.
  - Add an SPF record to your DNS settings: `v=spf1 include:spf.postmarkapp.com ~all`
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Enable DKIM to sign outgoing messages.
  - In Postmark, go to your domain settings to find the DKIM keys and add them to your DNS records.

### 2. Configure DMARC Policy

- Create a DMARC TXT record in your DNS settings. Here’s a basic example:

  ```text
  Host: _dmarc.yourdomain.com
  Value: "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@yourdomain.com"
  ```

- **Tip**: Start with `p=none` to monitor your DMARC results before enforcing stricter policies.
