## About

The S3 File Storage API module provides a secure and efficient solution for storing files of any size directly in an AWS S3 bucket.
This module requires an existing AWS account and aims to facilitate seamless integration with minimal configuration.

## Installation

To add the S3 File Storage Module to your project, run:

```bash
npx vratix add upload-to-s3
```

## .env

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

- **S3_BUCKET_NAME**: The S3 bucket where files will be stored
  - **Default**: None (required)
  - **Example**: `S3_BUCKET_NAME=my-s3-bucket`

> **Note:** Refer to the [Node.js AWS SDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html) for authentication best practices.
> The module automatically retrieves AWS credentials from your environment, with a recommendation to use AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) for local development.

## Dependencies

This module will install the `auth-basic` API module for user authentication and the `protectedRoute` middleware.

## Usage

To use this module, import the router from `@/routes/storeFileS3.js` into your entry point file (e.g., `server.ts`):

```typescript server.ts
import { router as storeFileRouter } from "@/routes/storeFileS3.js";

app.use("/store-file", storeFileRouter);
```

### File Uploads

The module uses `formidable` for parsing and streaming files to S3. The file should be sent with `multipart/form-data` content type.

> Each file is stored with a unique key in the format `owner:${userId}_name:${fileName}` to associate files with the uploading user.
> Returned file names are simplified to `fileName` only. You can adjust this logic as needed.

Below is an example React component that allows users to upload files directly from a front-end form:

```tsx /multipart/ /form-data/
import React, { useState } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

function FileUpload() {
  const [file, setFile] = useState<File | null>(null);

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!file) return;
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("file", file);

    await axios.post("/api/store-file/upload/${file.name}", formData, {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data" },
    });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="file"
        onChange={(e) => setFile(e.target.files?.[0] || null)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default FileUpload;
```
